# Weather App [(Demo)](https://noelsner.github.io/weather-app/)

This basic weather app was created as an introduction to using APIs. It uses openweathermap.org to display the weather when the user enters a location in the search bar.


## What I learned:
* Introduction to AJAX and Web APIs
* Introduction to Async/Await and .then
* Practice with DOM manipulation
